Watermarks often contain information about a document's creator or owner. Extracting them can provide insights into their origin or authenticity. Retrieving watermarks helps verify whether a document is genuine or has been tampered with, especially when dealing with contracts or legal files.Extracted watermarks, such as logos or text, can be reused in other documents or repurposed for branding and consistency in new materials.
Extracting watermarks provides metadata or branding details useful for audits or creating detailed reports about document sources.

To start, you should have Python and the [PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/asposepdfcloud/) installed on your system.
If the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github:

Watermarks can deter unauthorized use or distribution by clearly marking the document with ownership or copyright information, protecting original content from being misused or redistributed without permission.
In some cases, watermarks are added as a subtle design feature to enhance the look and feel of a document, providing a professional, polished appearance that reflects the brand identity.

**With our Python library you can:**

+ Combine PDF documents.
+ Split PDF Files.
+ Convert PDF to other formats, and vice versa.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
