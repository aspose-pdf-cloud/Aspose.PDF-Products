**Why do I need to split PDF documents?** Splitting PDFs with Python can be necessary when managing and organizing large documents or working in a data processing environment.  Sometimes a larger document requires only a separate section or set of pages. The PDF split allows you to highlight and extract the corresponding pages without the rest of the document.

Also, sending or sharing all of the PDFs may be inefficient, especially if the document is large and contains more information than necessary. When splitting PDFs, you only need to separate the corresponding pages, which makes the process faster and saves bandwidth.

Splitting PDF into smaller sections can reduce the file size, which is useful when you are having storage problems or loading documents onto systems with size restrictions.

To start, you should have Python and the [PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/asposepdfcloud/) installed on your system.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
