To extract Text from PDF, we'll use
[Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/). This Cloud SDK assists Python programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Python programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK. If the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github:

Extracting text allows data within PDFs to be analyzed, organized, or processed in external applications. Extracted text can be indexed, making it searchable across databases or content management systems.
This improves document retrieval and allows for faster access to specific information, especially in large document archives. By extracting text and saving it in a simpler format (like plain text or XML), users can reduce file sizes, making them easier to share or distribute.
Extract Text from PDF documents with [Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/).

**With our Python library you can:**

+ Combine PDF documents.
+ Split PDF Files.
+ Convert PDF to other formats, and vice versa.
+ Manipulate Annotations.
+ Work with Images in PDF, etc.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/parser) to extract text from PDF files online and test the functionality.
