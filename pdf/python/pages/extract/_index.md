To extract Pages from PDF, we'll use
[Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/). This Cloud SDK assists Python programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Python programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK. If the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github:

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Installation from Github" offSpacer="true" %}}

```bash

     
    pip install git+https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python.git


```

Extracting pages from a PDF is a common task that serves various purposes across different contexts. This process involves selecting specific pages from a larger document to create a new, separate PDF file. Understanding the reasons behind this practice can help in effectively managing and utilizing PDF documents.​ Large PDF files can be cumbersome to share or store. By extracting only the necessary pages, users can create smaller, more manageable files. This is particularly useful when only a portion of the document is relevant for a specific purpose. For instance, removing unnecessary pages can significantly decrease the file size, making it easier to handle and distribute. ​
Extracting pages allows users to repurpose content for different applications. For example, one might extract pages from a comprehensive report to create a standalone summary or to isolate specific data for analysis. This enables the reuse of existing content without the need to recreate information from scratch. Extract the Pages from PDF documents with [Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/).

**With our Python library you can:**

+ Combine PDF documents.
+ Split PDF Files.
+ Convert PDF to other formats, and vice versa.
+ Manipulate Annotations.
+ Work with Images in PDF, etc.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/family) to test the functionality online.
