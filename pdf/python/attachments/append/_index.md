 For working with attachments in PDF documents, we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/)
 This Cloud SDK assists Python programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Python programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK. If the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github: 

```bash

     
    pip install git+https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python.git


```

 Aspose.PDF Cloud Python developers can easily append attachments in PDF documents. Developers need just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load your Application Secret and Key from the JSON file or set credentials in another way
1. Create an object to connect to the Cloud API
1. Set name with path of your document file
1. Perform the appending attachment actions for PDf document using <b>post_add_document_attachment</b> or perform appending attachment annotation to page using <b>post_page_file_attachment_annotationspost_page_file_attachment_annotations</b> fumction or append popup annotation attachment with or <b>post_popup_annotation</b> function
1. The response from the Cloud API function will contain a description of the result of the action performed, or an error message if the Cloud API was unable to attach the attachments.

```python

# Create new Attachment for appending
attachment_info = AttachmentInfo(

    mime_type="image/png"
)

# Define callback-function for processing answer
def callback_function(response):
    print("Attachment successfully append: ", response)

# Using Rest API function
try:
    api.post_add_document_attachment(document_name, attachment_info, callback=callback_function)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failure appending attachment: {e}")

{{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PDF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/view/pdf/" >}}
Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
