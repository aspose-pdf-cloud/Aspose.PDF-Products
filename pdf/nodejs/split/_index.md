**Why do I need to split PDF documents?** Splitting PDFs with PHP can be necessary when managing and organizing large documents or working in a data processing environment.  Sometimes a larger document requires only a separate section or set of pages. The PDF split allows you to highlight and extract the corresponding pages without the rest of the document.

Also, sending or sharing all of the PDFs may be inefficient, especially if the document is large and contains more information than necessary. When splitting PDFs, you only need to separate the corresponding pages, which makes the process faster and saves bandwidth.

Splitting PDF into smaller sections can reduce the file size, which is useful when you are having storage problems or loading documents onto systems with size restrictions.

 A basic splitting pdfs programmatically with
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/nodejs/)
 APIs can be done with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load your Application Secret and Key from the JSON file or set credentials in another way
1. Create an object to connect to the Cloud API
1. Upload your document file
1. Splits the uploaded PDF document using the PDF API.
1. Download each split page as a separate PDF file and saves them locally.
