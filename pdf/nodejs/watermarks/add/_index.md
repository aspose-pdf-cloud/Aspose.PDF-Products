Adding watermarks to a PDF enhances security, branding, and providing context. Watermarks help discourage unauthorized sharing by clearly marking a document as "Confidential". They can also convey the status of the document, such as "Draft", "Approved", or "For Review", helping readers understand the context or stage of the document. Also,  watermarks can indicate copyright or ownership, reducing the likelihood of intellectual property theft and providing a legal standing in case of unauthorized reproduction. For many companies, watermarked documents can add a layer of professionalism and control over how documents are perceived and shared externally.

Watermarks can deter unauthorized use or distribution by clearly marking the document with ownership or copyright information, protecting original content from being misused or redistributed without permission.
