The following code snippet, by the Aspose.PDF, loads a PDF and custom font file, defines the item with the custom style (text color, background color, font, rotation, alignment, and spacing), and specifies the rectangle in which the paragraph should be placed on the page. This is useful for adding stylized text to a certain area of the PDF page.

To add text into PDF, we'll use
[Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/nodejs/). This Cloud SDK assists Node.js programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Node.js programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Read the local PDF file.
1. Upload the PDF file to the Aspose.PDF Cloud storage.
1. Create a TextState object with formatting options (font, size, color, etc.).
1. Create a Segment object with the text content and the TextState.
1. Create a TextLine object with the Segment.
1. Create a Paragraph object with the TextLine, formatting options, and positioning.
1. Adds the Paragraph to the PDF file using the PdfApi.putAddText() method.
1. Logs the status of the operation.

Text can be dynamically added to customize a PDF for a specific user, such as adding their name or personalized message. This is often used in marketing materials or for personalized reports. Adding text in specific fonts, colors, and alignments can make certain sections more readable and visually appealing, creating a better user experience. Text additions can help maintain consistent information across different PDF versions, avoiding manual edits and ensuring that key information remains in place.
Add the Text into PDF documents with [Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/nodejs/).

**With our Node.js library you can:**

+ Add PDF document's header & footer in text or image format.
+ Add tables & stamps (text or image) to PDF documents.
+ Append multiple PDF documents to an existing file.
+ Work with PDF attachments, annotations, & form fields.
+ Apply encryption or decryption to PDF documents & set a password.
+ Delete all stamps & tables from a page or entire PDF document.
+ Delete a specific stamp or table from the PDF document by its ID.
+ Replace single or multiple instances of text on a PDF page or from the entire document.
+ Extensive support for converting PDF documents to various other file formats.
+ Extract various elements of PDF files & make PDF documents optimized.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/editor) to add the text into PDF files online and test the functionality.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
