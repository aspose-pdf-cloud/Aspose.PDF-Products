To delete Images from PDF, we'll use
[Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/nodejs/). This Cloud SDK assists Node.js programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Node.js programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK.

Images often contribute significantly to the size of a PDF. Removing them can make the document smaller and easier to share, especially in email or online uploads.
Images may contain sensitive information, such as personal photos or proprietary visuals. Removing them ensures the document respects privacy or confidentiality requirements.
Removing images from a PDF is a strategic step in ensuring the document is optimized for specific use cases, whether it's for storage, sharing, or readability.
Delete the Images from PDF documents with [Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/nodejs/).

**With our Node.js library you can:**

+ Add PDF document's header & footer in text or image format.
+ Add tables & stamps (text or image) to PDF documents.
+ Append multiple PDF documents to an existing file.
+ Work with PDF attachments, annotations, & form fields.
+ Apply encryption or decryption to PDF documents & set a password.
+ Delete all stamps & tables from a page or entire PDF document.
+ Delete a specific stamp or table from the PDF document by its ID.
+ Replace single or multiple instances of text on a PDF page or from the entire document.
+ Extensive support for converting PDF documents to various other file formats.
+ Extract various elements of PDF files & make PDF documents optimized.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/crop) to change image dimensions in PDF files online and test the functionality.
