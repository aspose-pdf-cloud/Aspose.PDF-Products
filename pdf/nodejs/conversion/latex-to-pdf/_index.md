{{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="LATEX" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/latex/" >}}
A file with .latex extension is a text-based markup language file created with the typesetting system known as LaTex. In most of the cases, it is used to define the typesettings for publications, letters, books, and other similar cataloging in various fields. Latex file format enhances the document using specialized algorithms, commands for formatting of the document, and the tiniest details. Latex processors such as TeXworks, Texmaker, LaTeX Editor, proTeXt, and Notepad++ can be used to open and edit Tex files.

{{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PDF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/view/pdf/" >}}
Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
