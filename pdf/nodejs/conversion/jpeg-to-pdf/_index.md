 To convert JPEG to PDF, we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/nodejs/)
 This Cloud SDK SDK assists Node.js programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Node.js programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Open
 [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asposepdfcloud)
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.PDF Cloud,
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

[Aspose.PDF Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf) is a true REST API that enables you to perform a wide range of document processing operations including creation, manipulation, conversion and rendering of PDF documents in the cloud.
Our Cloud SDKs are wrappers around REST API in various programming languages, allowing you to process documents in language of your choice quickly and easily, gaining all benefits of strong types and IDE highlights. This repository contains new generation SDKs for Aspose.PDF Cloud and examples.
These SDKs are now fully supported. If you have any questions, see any bugs or have enhancement request, feel free to reach out to us at Free [Support Forums](https://forum.aspose.cloud/c/pdf).

{{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPEG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/" >}}
A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality.

{{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PDF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/view/pdf/" >}}
Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in the 1990s. A PDF file is a multi-platform document created by Adobe Acrobat or another PDF application. The PDF format is commonly used to save documents and publications in a standard format that can be viewed on multiple platforms, that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System.
PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features, and 3D objects in it that can become part of the source document.
