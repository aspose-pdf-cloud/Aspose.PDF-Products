To extract Images from PDF, we'll use
[Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/nodejs/). This Cloud SDK assists Node.js programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Node.js programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK.

Extracted images can be reused in other documents, presentations, or marketing materials, saving time and resources by avoiding re-creation. Once extracted, images can be edited or enhanced to improve their quality or adapt them for specific purposes, such as resizing or recoloring. Images extracted from a PDF can be stored separately for archival purposes, ensuring easy access and organization of visual content. By extracting images from a PDF, users can better manage, edit, and utilize visual content for a wide range of applications, from professional presentations to creative projects.
