Removing watermarks from PDF files is often necessary in certain contexts where watermarks may no longer be relevant or could impact the document's readability.
If a document previously marked as "Draft" or "Confidential" is now finalized or public, removing the watermark can prevent confusion and ensure that users understand the document’s current status. The Watermarks, especially those with high opacity, can obscure important text or images, making the document harder to read or causing visual distraction. For external sharing or formal submissions, it’s often necessary to remove watermarks that might look unpolished or make the document appear incomplete. Clean, watermark-free documents look more professional.

Watermarks can deter unauthorized use or distribution by clearly marking the document with ownership or copyright information, protecting original content from being misused or redistributed without permission.
In some cases, watermarks are added as a subtle design feature to enhance the look and feel of a document, providing a professional, polished appearance that reflects the brand identity.
