In order to delete an AcroForms from PDF, we'll use
[Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/nodejs/). This Cloud SDK assists Node.js programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Node.js programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK.

If a form is outdated, irrelevant, or no longer needed, deleting it helps streamline the document and maintain relevance. Removing forms can make a PDF simpler and easier to read, especially if the forms are no longer intended for interaction. Interactive elements like AcroForms can increase a PDF’s file size. Deleting them can optimize the document for faster sharing or storage.
Remove an AcroForms from PDF documents with [Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/nodejs/).

**With our Node.js library you can**

+ Add PDF document's header & footer in text or image format.
+ Add tables & stamps (text or image) to PDF documents.
+ Append multiple PDF documents to an existing file.
+ Work with PDF attachments, annotations, & form fields.
+ Apply encryption or decryption to PDF documents & set a password.
+ Delete all stamps & tables from a page or entire PDF document.
+ Delete a specific stamp or table from the PDF document by its ID.
+ Replace single or multiple instances of text on a PDF page or from the entire document.
+ Extensive support for converting PDF documents to various other file formats.
+ Extract various elements of PDF files & make PDF documents optimized.
