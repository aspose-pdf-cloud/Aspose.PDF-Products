 For parse PDF documents to extract Image by Id via Cloud Node.js SDK , we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/nodejs/)
 TThis Cloud SDK assists Node.js programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, converter and parser apps using Node.js programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK.

 Aspose.PDF Cloud developers can easily parse PDF documents for Image by Id extraction. Developers need just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Create a new Configuration object with your Application Secret and Key
1. Create an object to connect to the Cloud API
1. Upload your document file
1. Parse PDF documents for Image by Id extraction in cloud storage using getImageExtractAsPng function
1. Checks the response and logs the result
1. Download Image as PNG file locally if needed
