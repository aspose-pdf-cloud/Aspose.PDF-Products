 For parse PDF documents to extract Form fields as XML via Cloud Python SDK , we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/)
 This Cloud SDK assists Python programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, converter and parser apps using Python programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK. If the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github:

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Installation from Github" offSpacer="true" %}}

```bash

     
    pip install git+https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python.git
     
     

```

 Aspose.PDF Cloud developers can easily parse PDF documents for extraction Form fields as XML. Developers need just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Create a new Configuration object with your Application Secret and Key
1. Create an object to connect to the Cloud API
1. Upload your document file
1. Parse PDF documents for extraction Form fields as XML in cloud storage using put_export_fields_from_pdf_to_xml_in_storage function
1. Checks the response and logs the result
1. Download XML file locally if needed
