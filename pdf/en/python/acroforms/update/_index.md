The provided Python code is designed to update form fields in a PDF document using the Aspose PDF Cloud API. It imports necessary modules, reads a local PDF file, uploads it to the cloud, and then updates specific fields in the PDF. The function updateFormFields encapsulates the entire process, handling both file operations and API interactions. It also includes error handling to manage potential issues during file reading and API requests.

In order to update an AcroForm to PDF, we'll use
[Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/). This Cloud SDK assists Python programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Python programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK.

1. Reads PDF file from local path.
1. Upload the PDF file to the Aspose.PDF Cloud storage.
1. Creates a new form field with the name from "fieldName" parameter and sets its value to "aspose-pdf-cloud@example.com" value.
1. Updates the form fields in the PDF file on the Aspose.PDF Cloud storage.
1. Download the result if needed it

Updating AcroForms in a PDF involves modifying or enhancing existing interactive form fields. Improve field alignment, add tooltips, or adjust tab orders to make the form more intuitive and easier to use. Include additional fields such as checkboxes, dropdowns, or digital signature areas to accommodate new data collection needs.
Update AcroForms to comply with accessibility standards, such as adding labels or improving compatibility with assistive technologies. Update AcroForms to ensure compatibility with modern devices, browsers, or software tools.
Update the AcroForms into PDF documents with [Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/).

**With our Python library you can**

+ Add PDF document's header & footer in text or image format.
+ Add tables & stamps (text or image) to PDF documents.
+ Append multiple PDF documents to an existing file.
+ Work with PDF attachments, annotations, & form fields.
+ Apply encryption or decryption to PDF documents & set a password.
+ Delete all stamps & tables from a page or entire PDF document.
+ Delete a specific stamp or table from the PDF document by its ID.
+ Replace single or multiple instances of text on a PDF page or from the entire document.
+ Extensive support for converting PDF documents to various other file formats.
+ Extract various elements of PDF files & make PDF documents optimized.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/xfa) to update the AcroForms into PDF files online and test the functionality.
