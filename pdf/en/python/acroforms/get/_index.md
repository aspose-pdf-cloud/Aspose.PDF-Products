In order to get an AcroForms from PDF, we'll use
[Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/). This Cloud SDK assists Python programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, converter and acroform apps using Python programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK.

Aspose.PDF Cloud developers can easily load & get acroforms from PDF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Upload the PDF file to the Aspose.PDF Cloud service.
1. Log any errors that occur during the file upload.
1. Retrieve the form fields from the PDF file in the Aspose.PDF Cloud storage.
1. Iterate through the form fields and log the field names and values to the console.
1. Log any errors that occur during the field retrieval
1. Download the result if needed it

Extracting AcroForm data allows you to compile and analyze information collected from users efficiently, such as surveys or application responses. Retrieved AcroForm data can be integrated into databases, spreadsheets, or other systems for further processing or record-keeping. Extracting AcroForms helps in auditing filled-out forms to verify the accuracy, authenticity, or completeness of the provided data. Retrieving AcroForms is essential when transferring forms to other document management systems or creating backups.
Get the AcroForms from PDF documents with [Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/).

**With our Python library you can**
