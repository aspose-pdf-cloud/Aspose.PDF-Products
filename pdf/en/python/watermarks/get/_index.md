Watermarks often contain information about a document's creator or owner. Extracting them can provide insights into their origin or authenticity. Retrieving watermarks helps verify whether a document is genuine or has been tampered with, especially when dealing with contracts or legal files.Extracted watermarks, such as logos or text, can be reused in other documents or repurposed for branding and consistency in new materials.
Extracting watermarks provides metadata or branding details useful for audits or creating detailed reports about document sources.

To start, you should have Python and the [PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/asposepdfcloud/) installed on your system.
If the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github:

```bash

     
    pip install git+https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python.git

Watermarks can deter unauthorized use or distribution by clearly marking the document with ownership or copyright information, protecting original content from being misused or redistributed without permission.
In some cases, watermarks are added as a subtle design feature to enhance the look and feel of a document, providing a professional, polished appearance that reflects the brand identity.

**With our Python library you can:**

+ Combine PDF documents.
+ Split PDF Files.
+ Convert PDF to other formats, and vice versa.
+ Manipulate Annotations.
+ Work with Images in PDF, etc.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/remove-watermark) to delete watermarks from PDF files online and test the functionality.
