{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="Why do I need to Add Watermarks to PDF Files Using Python Cloud API" %}}

Adding watermarks to a PDF enhances security, branding, and providing context. Watermarks help discourage unauthorized sharing by clearly marking a document as "Confidential". They can also convey the status of the document, such as "Draft", "Approved", or "For Review", helping readers understand the context or stage of the document. Also,  watermarks can indicate copyright or ownership, reducing the likelihood of intellectual property theft and providing a legal standing in case of unauthorized reproduction. For many companies, watermarked documents can add a layer of professionalism and control over how documents are perceived and shared externally.

To start, you should have Python and the [PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/asposepdfcloud/) installed on your system.
If the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github: 

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Installation from Github" offSpacer="true" %}}

```bash

     
    pip install git+https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python.git


```

Watermarks can deter unauthorized use or distribution by clearly marking the document with ownership or copyright information, protecting original content from being misused or redistributed without permission.
In some cases, watermarks are added as a subtle design feature to enhance the look and feel of a document, providing a professional, polished appearance that reflects the brand identity.

**With our Python library you can:**

+ Combine PDF documents.
+ Split PDF Files.
+ Convert PDF to other formats, and vice versa.
+ Manipulate Annotations.
+ Work with Images in PDF, etc.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/watermark) to Add watermarks to PDF files online and test the functionality.
