{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="Why do I need to Remove Watermarks from PDF Files Using Python Cloud API" %}}

Removing watermarks from PDF files is often necessary in certain contexts where watermarks may no longer be relevant or could impact the document's readability. 
If a document previously marked as "Draft" or "Confidential" is now finalized or public, removing the watermark can prevent confusion and ensure that users understand the document’s current status. The Watermarks, especially those with high opacity, can obscure important text or images, making the document harder to read or causing visual distraction. For external sharing or formal submissions, it’s often necessary to remove watermarks that might look unpolished or make the document appear incomplete. Clean, watermark-free documents look more professional. 

To start, you should have Python and the [PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/asposepdfcloud/) installed on your system.
If the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github: 

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Installation from Github" offSpacer="true" %}}

```bash

     
    pip install git+https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python.git


```

	self.uploadFile(file_name)

	image = 'test.jpg'
	self.uploadFile(image)

	# Create an ImageStamp object to apply to the PDF document
	stamp = asposepdfcloud.models.ImageStamp()
	stamp.background = True
	stamp.left_margin = 1
	stamp.right_margin = 2
	stamp.top_margin = 3
	stamp.bottom_margin = 4

Watermarks can deter unauthorized use or distribution by clearly marking the document with ownership or copyright information, protecting original content from being misused or redistributed without permission.
In some cases, watermarks are added as a subtle design feature to enhance the look and feel of a document, providing a professional, polished appearance that reflects the brand identity.

**With our Python library you can:**

+ Combine PDF documents.
+ Split PDF Files.
+ Convert PDF to other formats, and vice versa.
+ Manipulate Annotations.
+ Work with Images in PDF, etc.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/remove-watermark) to delete watermarks from PDF files online and test the functionality.
