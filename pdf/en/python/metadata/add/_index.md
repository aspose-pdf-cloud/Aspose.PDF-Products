{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="How to create Metadata via Cloud Python SDK " %}}

To create Metadata, we'll use
[Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/)
This Cloud SDK assists Python programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Python programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK. If the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github:

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Installation from Github" offSpacer="true" %}}

```bash

     
    pip install git+https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python.git


```

    ])

Working with metadata in PDF files is important. Metadata such as the title field, author and theme help classify documents, making it easier to manage large collections of documents by providing a quick overview of content without opening files.
Metadata also improves file search by allowing you to search by keywords and attributes. This is particularly valuable in systems where the rapid retrieval of documents is essential.

**With our Python library you can:**

+ Combine PDF documents.
+ Split PDF Files.
+ Convert PDF to other formats, and vice versa.
+ Manipulate Annotations.
+ Work with Images in PDF, etc.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/metadata) to add metadata into PDF files online and test the functionality.
