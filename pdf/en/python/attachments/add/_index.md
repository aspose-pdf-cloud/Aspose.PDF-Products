 For working with attachments in PDF documents, we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/)
 This Cloud SDK assists Python programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Python programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK. If the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github: 

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Installation from Github" offSpacer="true" %}}

```bash

     
    pip install git+https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python.git


```

 Aspose.PDF Cloud Python developers can easily append attachments in PDF documents. Developers need just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load your Application Secret and Key from the JSON file or set credentials in another way
1. Create an object to connect to the Cloud API
1. Set name with path of your document file
1. Perform the appending attachment actions
1. If successful, the modified PDF is downloaded and saved to a specified file
1. If any errors occur during the process, they are caught and printed
