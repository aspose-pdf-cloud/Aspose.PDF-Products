 For working with attachments in PDF documents, we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/)
 This Cloud SDK SDK assists Python programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Python programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Open
 [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asposepdfcloud)
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.PDF Cloud,
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

```bash

     
    pip install git+https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python.git

 Aspose.PDF Cloud Python developers can easily extract attachments from PDF documents. Developers need just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load your Application Secret and Key from the JSON file or set credentials in another way
1. Create an object to connect to the Cloud API
1. Set name with path of your document file
1. Perform the extracting attachment actions
1. The response from the Cloud API function will contain an attachmants list
