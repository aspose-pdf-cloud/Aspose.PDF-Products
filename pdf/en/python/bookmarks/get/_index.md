To extract Bookmarks from PDF, we'll use [Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/). This Cloud SDK assists Python programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Python programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK. If the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github:

```bash

     
    pip install git+https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python.git


```

Aspose.PDF Cloud developers can easily load & extract Bookmarks from PDF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Install [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/asposepdfcloud/)
1. Upload a PDF document to the Aspose Cloud server
1. Get bookmark for a specific PDF document using bookmark path
