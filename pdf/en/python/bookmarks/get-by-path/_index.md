 To extract Bookmark by path from PDF, we'll use [Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/). This Cloud SDK assists Python programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Python programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK. If the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github:

```bash

    Â 
    pip install git+https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python.git


```

 Aspose.PDF Cloud Python developers can easily extract bookmark by path from PDF documents. Developers need just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Create a new Configuration object with your Application Secret and Key
1. Create an object to connect to the Cloud API
1. Upload your document file
1. Extract bookmark by path from PDF documents using GetBookmark function
1. Checks the response and logs the result
1. If the operation is successful, you can print the bookmark or use the bookmark in another way
