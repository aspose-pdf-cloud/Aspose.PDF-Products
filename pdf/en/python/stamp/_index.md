 In order to work with Stamps in PDF via Cloud Python SDK , we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/python/). This Cloud SDK assists Python programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Python programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Python SDK. If the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github:

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Installation from Github" offSpacer="true" %}}

```bash

     
    pip install git+https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python.git


```

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Aspose.PDF Cloud developers can easily load & create Stamps in PDF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Install [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/asposepdfcloud/)
1. Upload a PDF document to the Aspose Cloud server
1. Upload Image file to the Aspose Cloud server
1. Call API to insert Stamps
1. Download the processed PDF document from the Aspose Cloud server
