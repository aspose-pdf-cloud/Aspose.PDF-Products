Now, managing and organizing documents is essential for businesses and individuals. Merging multiple PDF files into one document simplifies sharing, archiving, and printing. Whether you need to combine multiple reports, invoices, or contracts, merging PDFs offers a clean, organized solution. With Aspose Cloud Go Library, you can easily merge multiple PDF documents programmatically using the power of cloud computing. This guide will walk you through merging PDF files using Aspose's Cloud API in Go.

**Why do I need to merge multiple PDF documents?**

Combine multiple related documents into a single file for easy management. Merge invoices, receipts, or reports for a client into a single file for streamlined sharing. Reduce the number of files in storage by consolidating them into one compact document. Save time by automating the process of merging multiple files.

**Merge PDFs with Go**

The PDF Cloud Go SDK offers an easy-to-use and secure API for merging PDF files quickly and accurately, even when dealing with complex formatting. Instead of manually combining files, you can merge them in seconds with just a single method call from the Go SDK. There's no need to install additional software—document merging happens in the cloud, offloading the process from your local system and saving resources.

1. Create a new MergeDocuments instance to hold the list of input document paths.
1. Upload each input PDF document to the remote folder and append its path to the mergeDocuments.List.
1. Prepare the arguments for the PutMergeDocuments API call.
