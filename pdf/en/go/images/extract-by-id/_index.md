 To extract image from PDF via Cloud Go SDK, we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Go SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/go/)
 This Cloud Go SDK assists Go programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Go programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Extracted images can be reused in other documents, presentations, or marketing materials, saving time and resources by avoiding re-creation. Once extracted, images can be edited or enhanced to improve their quality or adapt them for specific purposes, such as resizing or recoloring. Images extracted from a PDF can be stored separately for archival purposes, ensuring easy access and organization of visual content. By extracting images from a PDF, users can better manage, edit, and utilize visual content for a wide range of applications, from professional presentations to creative projects.
