 For getting bookmark by path from PDF documents, we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Go SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/go/)
 This Cloud SDK SDK assists Go programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Go programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Use the following command from the Package Manager Console.
