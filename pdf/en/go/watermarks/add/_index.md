 For adding watermarks to PDF documents, we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Go SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/go/)
 This Cloud Go SDK assists Go programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Go programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Watermarks can deter unauthorized use or distribution by clearly marking the document with ownership or copyright information, protecting original content from being misused or redistributed without permission. In some cases, watermarks are added as a subtle design feature to enhance the look and feel of a document, providing a professional, polished appearance that reflects the brand identity.
