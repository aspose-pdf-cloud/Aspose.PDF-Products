The provided Go code is designed to update form fields in a PDF document using the Aspose PDF Cloud API. It imports necessary modules, reads a local PDF file, uploads it to the cloud, and then updates specific fields in the PDF. The function updateFormFields encapsulates the entire process, handling both file operations and API interactions. It also includes error handling to manage potential issues during file reading and API requests.

In order to update an AcroForm to PDF, we'll use
[Aspose.PDF Cloud Go SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/go/). This Cloud SDK assists Go programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Go programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Go SDK.

Updating AcroForms in a PDF involves modifying or enhancing existing interactive form fields. Improve field alignment, add tooltips, or adjust tab orders to make the form more intuitive and easier to use. Include additional fields such as checkboxes, dropdowns, or digital signature areas to accommodate new data collection needs.
Update AcroForms to comply with accessibility standards, such as adding labels or improving compatibility with assistive technologies. Update AcroForms to ensure compatibility with modern devices, browsers, or software tools.
Update the AcroForms into PDF documents with [Aspose.PDF Cloud Go SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/go/).
