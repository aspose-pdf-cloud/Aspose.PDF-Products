In order to get an AcroForms from PDF, we'll use
[Aspose.PDF Cloud Go SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/go/). This Cloud SDK assists Go programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using Go programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud Go SDK.

Extracting AcroForm data allows you to compile and analyze information collected from users efficiently, such as surveys or application responses. Retrieved AcroForm data can be integrated into databases, spreadsheets, or other systems for further processing or record-keeping. Extracting AcroForms helps in auditing filled-out forms to verify the accuracy, authenticity, or completeness of the provided data.
