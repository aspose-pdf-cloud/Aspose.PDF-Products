​Removing pages from a PDF is a common task that serves multiple purposes, enhancing both the functionality and security of the document. PDFs can become unwieldy when they contain unnecessary or redundant pages, leading to larger file sizes. By removing these superfluous pages, the overall file size is reduced, making the document more manageable for storage and quicker to upload or download. Over time, documents may accumulate outdated or irrelevant information. Removing such pages ensures that the content remains current and pertinent to the intended audience. Removing pages from a PDF is a practical approach to optimize document size, enhance relevance, protect sensitive information, improve navigation, maintain accuracy, and facilitate collaboration.
