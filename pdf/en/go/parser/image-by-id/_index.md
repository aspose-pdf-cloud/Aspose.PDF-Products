 For parse PDF documents to extract Image by Id via Cloud Go SDK , we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Go SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/go/)
 This Cloud Go SDK assists Go programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, converter and parser apps using Go programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Package Manager Console Command" offSpacer="true" %}}

```bash

     
    go get -u github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-go/v25

 Aspose.PDF Cloud developers can easily parse PDF documents for Image by Id extraction. Developers need just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Create a new Configuration object with your Application Secret and Key
1. Create an object to connect to the Cloud API
1. Upload your document file
1. Parse PDF documents for Image by Id extraction in cloud storage using GetImageExtractAsPng function
1. Checks the response and logs the result
1. Download Image as PNG file locally if needed

		f, _ := os.Create(fileName)
		_, _ = f.Write(response)
		fmt.Println("File '" + fileName + "' successfully downloaded.")
