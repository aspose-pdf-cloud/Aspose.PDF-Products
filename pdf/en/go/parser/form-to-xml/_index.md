 For parse PDF documents to extract Form fields as XML via Cloud Go SDK , we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Go SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/go/)
 This Cloud Go SDK assists Go programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, converter and parser apps using Go programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.PDF Cloud developers can easily parse PDF documents for extraction Form fields as XML. Developers need just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Create a new Configuration object with your Application Secret and Key
1. Create an object to connect to the Cloud API
1. Upload your document file
1. Parse PDF documents for extraction Form fields as XML in cloud storage using PutExportFieldsFromPdfToXmlInStorage function
1. Checks the response and logs the result
1. Download XNL file locally if needed
