In order to set an AcroForms from PDF, we'll use
[Aspose.PDF Cloud PHP SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/php/). This Cloud SDK assists PHP programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using PHP programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud PHP SDK.

Setting AcroForms allows users to fill in information directly in the PDF, eliminating the need for separate tools or formats. Properly setting AcroForms ensures better usability, such as clear field labels, dropdown options, and logical tab orders for better navigation. Well-configured forms make it easy for multiple parties to fill out, review, and approve documents together. By setting AcroForms in PDFs, you can create reusable templates for recurring processes, saving time and ensuring consistency across documents.
