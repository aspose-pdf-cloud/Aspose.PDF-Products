 For getting page annotations from PDF documents, we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Java SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/java/)
 This Cloud SDK allows you to easily build cloud-based PDF creator, editor & converter apps in Java language for various cloud platforms. Open
 [Repository](https://releases.aspose.cloud/java/repo/com/aspose/aspose-pdf-cloud/)
 package manager, search for Aspose.PDF Cloud
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console for install it using Maven.

Add Aspose Cloud repository to your application pom.xml

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Add Aspose Cloud repository" offSpacer="true" %}}

```xml

    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>aspose-cloud</id>
            <name>Aspose Cloud Repository</name>
            <url>https://releases.aspose.cloud/java/repo/</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>


```

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block %}}

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Installation from Github" offSpacer="true" %}}

```bash

    mvn clean install

```

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block %}}


To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Deploy Maven repository" offSpacer="true" %}}

```bash

    mvn clean deploy


```

 Aspose.PDF Cloud developers can easily load & get annotations from PDF documents in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Uploads a document.
1. Retrieves all annotations from a specified page.
1. Logs details of each.
1. Returns the ID of the first Text annotation (for further actions like editing or deletion).

Adding annotations to a PDF serves many important purposes across different use cases. One of the most common reasons is for review and feedback. Annotations let users highlight specific parts of a document, leave comments, ask questions, or suggest changes. This makes the review process more efficient and organized, especially when multiple collaborators are involved.
Add the Annotations into PDF documents with [Aspose.PDF Cloud Java SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/java/).

**With our Java SDK you can**

+ Add PDF document's header & footer in text or image format.
+ Add tables & text or image stamps to PDF documents.
+ Append multiple PDF documents to an existing file.
+ Work with PDF attachments, annotations, & form fields.
+ Apply encryption or decryption to PDF documents & set a password.
+ Delete all stamps & tables from a page or entire PDF document.
+ Delete a specific stamp or table from the PDF document by its ID.
+ Replace single or multiple instances of text on a PDF page or from the entire document.
+ Extensive support for converting PDF documents to various other file formats.
+ Extract various elements of PDF files & make PDF documents optimized.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/) to add the annotations into PDF files online and test the functionality.
