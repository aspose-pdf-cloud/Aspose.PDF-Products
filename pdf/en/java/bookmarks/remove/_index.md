 In order to delete bookmark from PDF documents via Cloud Java SDK, we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud Java SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/java/)
 This Cloud SDK allows you to easily build cloud-based PDF creator, editor & converter apps in Java language for various cloud platforms. Open
 [Repository](https://releases.aspose.cloud/java/repo/com/aspose/aspose-pdf-cloud/)
 package manager, search for Aspose.PDF Cloud
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console for install it using Maven.

Add Aspose Cloud repository to your application pom.xml

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Add Aspose Cloud repository" offSpacer="true" %}}

```xml

    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>aspose-cloud</id>
            <name>Aspose Cloud Repository</name>
            <url>https://releases.aspose.cloud/java/repo/</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>


```

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block %}}

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Installation from Github" offSpacer="true" %}}

```bash

    mvn clean install

```

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block %}}


To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```bash

    mvn clean deploy
