 For getting signatures from PDF documents via Cloud .NET SDK , we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud .NET SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/net/)
 This Cloud SDK allows you to easily build cloud-based PDF creator, editor & converter apps in C#, ASP.NET, or other .NET languages for various cloud platforms. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Pdf-Cloud)
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.PDF Cloud
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.PDF Cloud developers can easily extract signatures from PDF documents. Developers need just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Create a new Configuration object with your Application Secret and Key
1. Create an object to connect to the Cloud API
1. Upload your document file
1. Extract signatures from PDF documents in cloud starage using GetDocumentSignatureFieldsAsync function
1. Checks the response and logs the result
1. If the operation was successful, print the list of signatures
