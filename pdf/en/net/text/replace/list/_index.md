Mass replacement of texts in a PDF document can be easily implemented by the user, for example when correcting errors in the text or replacing identical fragments of text. This is often used in marketing materials or for personalized reports. Replacing text with specific fonts, colors and alignments can make some sections more clear and visually appealing, creating a better user experience. Text replacement can help to keep the information sequence in different PDF versions, avoiding manual editing and ensuring that key information remains in place.
