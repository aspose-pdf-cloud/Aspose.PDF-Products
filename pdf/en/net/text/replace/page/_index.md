Text can be dynamically replaced in PDF document for a specific user, such as correcting mistakes in text or replacing text fragments. This is often used in marketing materials or for personalized reports. Replacing text in specific fonts, colors, and alignments can make certain sections more readable and visually appealing, creating a better user experience. Text replacements can help maintain consistent information across different PDF versions, avoiding manual edits and ensuring that key information remains in place.
