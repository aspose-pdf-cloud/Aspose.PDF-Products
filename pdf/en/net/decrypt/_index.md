 For decrypt PDF documents, we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud .NET SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/net/)
 This Cloud SDK assists .NET programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using C#, ASP.NET,
or other .NET languages for various cloud platforms.Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Pdf-Cloud)
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.PDF Cloud
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

1. Create a new Configuration object with your Application Secret and Key
1. Create an object to connect to the Cloud API
1. Upload your encrypted document file
1. Call API to Decrypt Pdf document.
1. Checks the response and logs the result.
1. Downloads the updated file for local use.

Decrypting a PDF document is crucial when access to its contents is restricted due to encryption. It allows authorized users to regain full control over the file, enabling editing, viewing, and content extraction. This process is especially important in workflows where secure documents must be accessed programmatically or integrated into larger systems.

Using tools like Aspose.PDF Cloud, decryption can be performed easily and securely with just the correct owner or user password. This ensures sensitive information remains protected while still allowing flexibility for those who need legitimate access.

Ultimately, decrypting a PDF enables smooth document handling and reinforces the importance of strong yet manageable document security practices.
Decrypt PDF documents with [Aspose.PDF Cloud .NET SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/net/).

**With our .NET library you can:**

+ Add PDF document's header & footer in text or image format.
