Deleting tables from documents may be required to simplify the document when tables carry not needed information, to ensure confidentiality when tables contain personal data, prices, contacts or other sensitive information, to prepare for reuse, if the document is needed as a template, for automatic processing, for optimization when printing, for editing and updating information if the tables are outdated or contain errors.
