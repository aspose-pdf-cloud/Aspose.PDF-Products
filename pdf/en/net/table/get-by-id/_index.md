Tables provide a structured format for presenting data systematically, making it easier for readers to understand and analyze information. They also enhance the visual appeal of a document, adding professionalism and organization. When dealing with numerical or comparative data, tables improve clarity by grouping related information in an easy-to-read format. Additionally, tables can incorporate real-time or dynamically generated content, such as data from databases or analytics dashboards.
