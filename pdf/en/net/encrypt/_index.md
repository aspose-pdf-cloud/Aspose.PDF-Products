 For encrypt PDF documents, we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud .NET SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/net/)
 This Cloud SDK assists .NET programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using C#, ASP.NET,
or other .NET languages for various cloud platforms.Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Pdf-Cloud)
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.PDF Cloud
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.
