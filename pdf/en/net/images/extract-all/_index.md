Extracted images can be reused in other documents, presentations, or marketing materials, saving time and resources by avoiding re-creation. Once extracted, images can be edited or enhanced to improve their quality or adapt them for specific purposes, such as resizing or recoloring. Images extracted from a PDF can be stored separately for archival purposes, ensuring easy access and organization of visual content. By extracting images from a PDF, users can better manage, edit, and utilize visual content for a wide range of applications, from professional presentations to creative projects.
