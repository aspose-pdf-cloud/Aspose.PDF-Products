 To extract image from PDF via Cloud .NET SDK, we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud .NET SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/net/)
 This Cloud SDK allows you to easily build cloud-based PDF creator, editor & converter apps in C#, ASP.NET, or other .NET languages for various cloud platforms. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Pdf-Cloud)
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.PDF Cloud
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Extracted images can be reused in other documents, presentations, or marketing materials, saving time and resources by avoiding re-creation. Once extracted, images can be edited or enhanced to improve their quality or adapt them for specific purposes, such as resizing or recoloring. Images extracted from a PDF can be stored separately for archival purposes, ensuring easy access and organization of visual content. By extracting images from a PDF, users can better manage, edit, and utilize visual content for a wide range of applications, from professional presentations to creative projects.
