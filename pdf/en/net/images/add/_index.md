To add images into PDF via Cloud .NET SDK, we'll use
[Aspose.PDF Cloud .NET SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/net/)
 This Cloud SDK allows you to easily build cloud-based PDF creator, editor & converter apps in C#, ASP.NET, or other .NET languages for various cloud platforms. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Pdf-Cloud)
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.PDF Cloud
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Aspose.PDF Cloud developers can easily load & add images into PDF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Initialize the Aspose PDF API
1. Upload the PDF Document to Cloud Storage
1. Reads a local image file and uploads it to the Aspose.PDF Cloud storage.
1. Inserts the uploaded image into the uploaded PDF file at a specific location.
1. Download the result if needed it

Images make documents visually engaging and help break up large blocks of text, making them more attractive to readers.
Photos, screenshots, or icons can add context to the content, making it more relatable and meaningful for the audience.
Including images in PDFs is essential for creating engaging presentations, user manuals, marketing brochures, and educational materials.
Add the Images into PDF documents with [Aspose.PDF Cloud .NET SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/net/).

**With our .NET library you can:**

+ Add PDF document's header & footer in text or image format.
+ Add tables & stamps (text or image) to PDF documents.
+ Append multiple PDF documents to an existing file.
+ Work with PDF attachments, annotations, & form fields.
+ Apply encryption or decryption to PDF documents & set a password.
+ Delete all stamps & tables from a page or entire PDF document.
+ Delete a specific stamp or table from the PDF document by its ID.
+ Replace single or multiple instances of text on a PDF page or from the entire document.
+ Extensive support for converting PDF documents to various other file formats.
+ Extract various elements of PDF files & make PDF documents optimized.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/crop) to change image dimensions in PDF files online and test the functionality.
