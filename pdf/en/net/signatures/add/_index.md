 In order to append signature via Cloud .NET SDK , we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud .NET SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/net/)
 This Cloud SDK allows you to easily build cloud-based PDF creator, editor & converter apps in C#, ASP.NET, or other .NET languages for various cloud platforms. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Pdf-Cloud)
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.PDF Cloud
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Package Manager Console Command" offSpacer="true" %}}

```powershell

     
    PM> Install-Package Aspose.Pdf-Cloud
     
     

```

 Aspose.PDF Cloud developers can easily load & sign PDF documents in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Create a new Configuration object with your Application Secret and Key
1. Create an object to connect to the Cloud API
1. Upload your document file
1. Create signature objetcts
1. Sign PDF document in cloud storage using signature objects and method PostSignatureFieldAsync for the Cloud API
1. Checks the response and logs the result.
1. Downloads the updated file for local use.

Adding signatures for PDF documents to confirm the authenticity of the author and ensure the legal validity of the signature, guarantee that the document has not been changed after signing, as well as to protect against forgery and unauthorized access. The electronic signature identifies the signer, records the date and time of signing and can be used to verify the document integrity.  
Add the Signature for PDF documents with [Aspose.PDF Cloud .NET SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/net/).

**With our .NET SDK you can**

+ Add PDF document's header & footer in text or image format.
+ Add tables & text or image stamps to PDF documents.
+ Append multiple PDF documents to an existing file.
+ Work with PDF attachments, annotations, & form fields.
+ Apply encryption or decryption to PDF documents & set a password.
+ Delete all stamps & tables from a page or entire PDF document.
+ Delete a specific stamp or table from the PDF document by its ID.
+ Replace single or multiple instances of text on a PDF page or from the entire document.
+ Extensive support for converting PDF documents to various other file formats.
+ Extract various elements of PDF files & make PDF documents optimized.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/family) to test the functionality online.
