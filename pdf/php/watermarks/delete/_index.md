{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="Why do I need to Remove Watermarks from PDF Files Using PHP Cloud API" %}}

Removing watermarks from PDF files is often necessary in certain contexts where watermarks may no longer be relevant or could impact the document's readability.
If a document previously marked as "Draft" or "Confidential" is now finalized or public, removing the watermark can prevent confusion and ensure that users understand the document’s current status. The Watermarks, especially those with high opacity, can obscure important text or images, making the document harder to read or causing visual distraction. For external sharing or formal submissions, it’s often necessary to remove watermarks that might look unpolished or make the document appear incomplete. Clean, watermark-free documents look more professional.

Watermarks can deter unauthorized use or distribution by clearly marking the document with ownership or copyright information, protecting original content from being misused or redistributed without permission.
In some cases, watermarks are added as a subtle design feature to enhance the look and feel of a document, providing a professional, polished appearance that reflects the brand identity.

**With our PHP library you can:**

+ Add PDF document's header & footer in text or image format.
+ Add tables & stamps (text or image) to PDF documents.
+ Append multiple PDF documents to an existing file.
+ Work with PDF attachments, annotations, & form fields.
+ Apply encryption or decryption to PDF documents & set a password.
+ Delete all stamps & tables from a page or entire PDF document.
+ Delete a specific stamp or table from the PDF document by its ID.
+ Replace single or multiple instances of text on a PDF page or from the entire document.
+ Extensive support for converting PDF documents to various other file formats.
+ Extract various elements of PDF files & make PDF documents optimized.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/remove-watermark) to delete watermarks from PDF files online and test the functionality.
