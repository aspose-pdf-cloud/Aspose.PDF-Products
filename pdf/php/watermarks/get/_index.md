Watermarks often contain information about a document's creator or owner. Extracting them can provide insights into their origin or authenticity. Retrieving watermarks helps verify whether a document is genuine or has been tampered with, especially when dealing with contracts or legal files.Extracted watermarks, such as logos or text, can be reused in other documents or repurposed for branding and consistency in new materials.
Extracting watermarks provides metadata or branding details useful for audits or creating detailed reports about document sources.

Watermarks can deter unauthorized use or distribution by clearly marking the document with ownership or copyright information, protecting original content from being misused or redistributed without permission.
In some cases, watermarks are added as a subtle design feature to enhance the look and feel of a document, providing a professional, polished appearance that reflects the brand identity.

**With our PHP library you can:**

+ Add PDF document's header & footer in text or image format.
+ Add tables & stamps (text or image) to PDF documents.
+ Append multiple PDF documents to an existing file.
+ Work with PDF attachments, annotations, & form fields.
+ Apply encryption or decryption to PDF documents & set a password.
+ Delete all stamps & tables from a page or entire PDF document.
+ Delete a specific stamp or table from the PDF document by its ID.
+ Replace single or multiple instances of text on a PDF page or from the entire document.
+ Extensive support for converting PDF documents to various other file formats.
+ Extract various elements of PDF files & make PDF documents optimized.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/remove-watermark) to delete watermarks from PDF files online and test the functionality.
