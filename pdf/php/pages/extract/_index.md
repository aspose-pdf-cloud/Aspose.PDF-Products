Extracting pages from a PDF is a common task that serves various purposes across different contexts. This process involves selecting specific pages from a larger document to create a new, separate PDF file. Understanding the reasons behind this practice can help in effectively managing and utilizing PDF documents.​ Large PDF files can be cumbersome to share or store. By extracting only the necessary pages, users can create smaller, more manageable files. This is particularly useful when only a portion of the document is relevant for a specific purpose. For instance, removing unnecessary pages can significantly decrease the file size, making it easier to handle and distribute. ​
Extracting pages allows users to repurpose content for different applications. For example, one might extract pages from a comprehensive report to create a standalone summary or to isolate specific data for analysis. This enables the reuse of existing content without the need to recreate information from scratch. Extract the Pages from PDF documents with [Aspose.PDF Cloud PHP SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/php/).

**With our PHP library you can:**

+ Add PDF document's header & footer in text or image format.
+ Add tables & stamps (text or image) to PDF documents.
+ Append multiple PDF documents to an existing file.
+ Work with PDF attachments, annotations, & form fields.
+ Apply encryption or decryption to PDF documents & set a password.
+ Delete all stamps & tables from a page or entire PDF document.
+ Delete a specific stamp or table from the PDF document by its ID.
+ Replace single or multiple instances of text on a PDF page or from the entire document.
+ Extensive support for converting PDF documents to various other file formats.
+ Extract various elements of PDF files & make PDF documents optimized.
+ You can try out our [free App](https://products.aspose.app/pdf/family) to test the functionality online.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
