 Aspose.PDF Cloud PHP developers can easily append attachments in PDF documents. Developers need just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Configuration and connection: create a Configuration instance and a PdfApi instance by passing the key and SID.
1. Upload file for attachment: first, we upload the file that we want to add to PDF into the cloud storage of Aspose using <b>uploadFile</b> function.
1. Append file as attachments: after successful download of the file, call <b>postAddDocumentAttachment</b>, by passing the PDF name and the name of the downloaded file.
1. Success check: if the API response is successful (code 200), the attachment is successfully added to the PDF.

{{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PDF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/view/pdf/" >}}
Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
