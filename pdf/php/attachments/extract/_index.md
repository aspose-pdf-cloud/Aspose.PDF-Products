[Aspose.PDF Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf) is a true REST API that enables you to perform a wide range of document processing operations including creation, manipulation, conversion and rendering of PDF documents in the cloud.
Our Cloud SDKs are wrappers around REST API in various programming languages, allowing you to process documents in language of your choice quickly and easily, gaining all benefits of strong types and IDE highlights. This repository contains new generation SDKs for Aspose.PDF Cloud and examples.
These SDKs are now fully supported. If you have any questions, see any bugs or have enhancement request, feel free to reach out to us at Free [Support Forums](https://forum.aspose.cloud/c/pdf).

{{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PDF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/view/pdf/" >}}
Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
