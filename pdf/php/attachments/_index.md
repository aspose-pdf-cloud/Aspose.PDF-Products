 For working with attachments in PDF documents, we'll use
 [Aspose.PDF Cloud PHP SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/php/)
 This Cloud SDK assists PHP programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using PHP programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud PHP SDK. If the PHP package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github: 

{{< blocks/products/pf/tab-content >}}
<p>Aspose.PDF Cloud PHP SDK allows cloud application developers to build cloud-based PDF generator, editor & converter apps to access and process PDF files hosted on a cloud storage, without installing any third-party software. Aspose.PDF Cloud PHP SDK is available under an MIT license and is built on top of Aspose.PDF REST API.</p>
<p>You can create a brand new PDF file or convert your existing documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, ebooks, HTML or PS files to cloud PDF. Furthermore, you can use simple PHP commands to merge multiple cloud PDF files, split PDF, append, encrypt, decrypt, apply watermark, bookmark, annotations or digitally sign your cloud-based PDF documents.</p>
<p>Aspose.PDF Cloud PHP SDK enables your PHP cloud programs to export data from PDF documents, add OCR layers to cloud PDF files, add header & footer. You can also download attachments from cloud PDF files using our REST API.</p>

{{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PDF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/view/pdf/" >}}
Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
