 To convert PDF to XLSX, we'll use
[Aspose.PDF Cloud PHP SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/php/)
This Cloud SDK assists PHP programmers in developing cloud-based PDF creator, annotator, editor, and converter apps using PHP programming language via Aspose.PDF REST API. Simply create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information. Once you have the App SID & key, you are ready to give the Aspose.PDF Cloud PHP SDK.
