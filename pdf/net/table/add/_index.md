Tables provide a structured format for presenting data systematically, making it easier for readers to understand and analyze information. They also enhance the visual appeal of a document, adding professionalism and organization. When dealing with numerical or comparative data, tables improve clarity by grouping related information in an easy-to-read format. Additionally, tables can incorporate real-time or dynamically generated content, such as data from databases or analytics dashboards.
Add the Table into PDF documents with [Aspose.PDF Cloud Node.js SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/pdf/net/).

**With our .NET library you can:**

+ Add PDF document's header & footer in text or image format.
+ Add tables & stamps (text or image) to PDF documents.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
